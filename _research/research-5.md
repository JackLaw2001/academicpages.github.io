**Introduction**: This research project aims to advance zeroing neural networks (ZNNs) by developing an adaptive-parameter model that enhances both intelligence and efficiency. Unlike deep neural networks, ZNNs feature a shallow structure and vector-valued error functions, making them effective for solving time-varying equations and addressing engineering challenges. The project focuses on integrating characteristics from both varying-parameter and fuzzy-parameter ZNNs to achieve a balance between performance and adaptability. We plan to verify and apply the novel model to multiple applications ranging from classic time-varying equations solving to  chaos synchronization control.

**Description**: 
1. Design an adaptive-parameter zeroing neural network which is both intelligent and efficient  
<u>Abstract</u>: *Zeroing neural networks (ZNNs), a type of Hopfield-like neural network, are widely used for tasks such as tracking control, optimization, and quaternion equations. To improve ZNN performance, various advanced models have been developed, incorporating features like fixed-time convergence, robustness, and adaptiveness. Among these, adaptive convergence ZNN models are particularly notable.  
Adaptive-parameter ZNN models are divided into two categories: varying-parameter and fuzzy-parameter models. Varying-parameter ZNNs are efficient due to their simple time-dependent convergence parameters but lack adaptability as they do not adjust to system states according to feedback. In contrast, fuzzy-parameter ZNNs are more intelligent, with convergence parameters adjusted based on system error through fuzzy logic. However, fuzzy logic systems can be computationally intensive.  
Designing an adaptive-parameter ZNN that achieves both intelligence and efficiency is therefore a significant and valuable goal.*

1. ZNN-based solver for complex-valued and quaternion-valued time-varying linear matrix inequality  
<u>Abstract</u>: *Zeroing neural networks (ZNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in addressing time-varying linear matrix inequality (TV-LMI) problems. Recent applications of ZNNs have included noise-tolerant models and variations with novel activation functions designed to tackle TV-LMI challenges. While much of this work has focused on real-valued TV-LMIs, there is a significant research gap in applying ZNNs to complex-valued (TVCV-LMI) and quaternion-valued (TVQV-LMI) TV-LMI problems.  
Complex-valued ZNNs have recently been developed to handle equations involving complex numbers, with models either activating the real and imaginary parts or just the magnitudes. Despite these advances, the applications of complex-valued and quaternion-valued ZNNs in solving TV-LMI remain underexplored.  
This study aims to address these gaps by extending adaptive-parameter ZNNs to the complex and quaternion domains, providing new solutions for TVCV-LMI and TVQV-LMI problems.*
