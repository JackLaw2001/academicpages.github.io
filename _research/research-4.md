**Introduction**: Cortical folding refers to the complex process by which the brainâ€™s outer layer, the cerebral cortex, develops folds and grooves. This folding increases the surface area of the cortex, allowing for a greater number of neurons and enhanced cognitive functions. Despite the vast diversity in size and function across mammalian cerebral cortices, research has demonstrated that the folding patterns of these cortices adhere to a simple, [universal scaling law](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0421-7). Derived from this powerful universal scaling law, we can further obtain the [independent components of human brain morphology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920310314). These metrics constitute the most important tools in the cortical folding analysis toolbox. Based on this toolbox, we can explore the differences between the experimental group and normal people to further understand the mechanism of diseases.
