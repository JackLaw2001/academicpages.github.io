**Introduction**: As one of the most common neurological disorders, epilepsy affects millions of families around the world. The characteristics of epileptic seizures vary, depending on where in the brain the disturbance first occurs and how far it spreads. Transient symptoms may occur, such as loss of consciousness or perception, and disturbances in movement, sensation, mood, or other cognitive functions. In many cases, patients with epilepsy die not because of epilepsy itself, but because of unexpected accidents caused by it, such as falls, burns, and drowning. Thus, it is crucial for us to predict seizures and take appropriate measures to prevent serious accidents. As a general disease name, there are many types of seizures, and patients with different seizures usually have different symptoms and treatment options. It is also important for us to find out what type of seizure the patient is suffering from and select appropriate treatment plan. In this project, I aim to develop seizure detection and classification algorithms based on EEG. Although it did not go well, my initial research goal was to achieve seizre detection and prediction with few samples or unlabeled samples. In the same context, I supervised an undergraduate student to help her complete her thesis.

**Description**: 
1. FASEDenseNet: A Module Embedded Convolutional Neural Network for Scalp EEG based Epilepsy Prediction (Seizure Prediction, UG Project)
<u>Abstract</u>: *Epilepsy is considered a common neurological disorder. It not only has a major effect on the patientâ€™s life but also can be lifethreatening. The cause of death in epilepsy patients is less likely by epileptic seizure but most commonly caused by accidents that happened during seizure onset such as car accidents, drowning and serious head injury caused by falling off. Therefore, it is important to predict the epileptic seizure to maximally prevent the serious effects of the patients. There are many existing models for helping to predict epilepsy. However, the most current models require complex preprocess and try to use deeper networks to enhance seizure prediction ability. Therefore, this research aims to design a better patient general model for seizure prediction using scalp EEG data with a simpler but efficient structure. The proposed model, Focal Adaption Squeeze Excite Densely Connected Convolutional Network (FASEDenseNet) has achieved outstanding results with an average sensitivity of 100% in classifying the normal EEG data and the data before seizure onset from different patients using CHB-MIT and Siena datasets. It used a channel focal adaptation module to enhance the model feature extraction ability and reduce the network depth. The proposed model shows outstanding robustness in achieving all correct predictions using the resampled data generated by different fixed windows, which shows that it is not restricted to preprocess and has better flexibility.*

2. EEGGraphNet: A multi-class seizure classification model based on deep spatiotemporal feature extraction
<u>Abstract</u>: *In recent years, numerous algorithms have been developed for binary seizure detection. However, multi-class seizure classification has received less attention. In this study, we introduce a novel electroencephalogram (EEG) graph network, EEGGraphNet, designed specifically for classifying different seizure types. By combining a graph attention network with a gated recurrent unit, EEGGraphNet effectively captures both the spatial and temporal features of EEG data. Furthermore, unlike many previous studies that rely on seizure-wise evaluation, which may not reflect real-world scenarios, we conduct a comprehensive assessment using both seizure-wise and patient-wise evaluation methods. Our experiments demonstrate that EEGGraphNet achieves weighted F1 scores of 98.15% for seizure-wise evaluation and 86.11% for patient-wise evaluation. Additionally, comparisons with other state-of-the-art models reveal that EEGGraphNet matches or surpasses existing performance levels.*
