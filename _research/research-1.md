**Funding**: This project is funded by the *Hunan Province College Students Research Learning and Innovative Experiment Project*, and I am the principal investigator.

**Introduction**: As a rising technology, near-infrared spectroscopy is being widely used in food, medicine, and other fields. For example, by scanning traditional Chinese medicine, we can obtain important physical and chemical indicators of these traditional Chinese medicines. However, such detection processes are carried out under laboratory conditions. As a result, the instruments used are expensive, and massive industrial applications cannot be realized. Recently, a MEMS technology has emerged, which can make the spectrometer only the size of a palm, and at the same time greatly reduce the price. These new technologies have laid the foundation for the popularization of near-infrared-spectroscopy-based substance analysis systems. In this project, we designed a substance analysis system based on the MEMS near-infrared spectroscopy module. I am mainly responsible for designing AI models in this project. Firstly, I designed an AI model based on data preprocessing, machine learning, deep learning modeling, etc. Then, I designed an API based on the Django REST framework so that users can upload the obtained data and get the results. The project is of great commercial value. Based on this project, we have participated in many innovation, entrepreneurship, and programming competitions.

**Description**: 
1. A Study on Identification Model of Apple Tree Varieties Based on Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder  
<u>Abstract</u>: *Combining the convolutional denoising autoencoder and random forest algorithm, a new convolutional denoising autoencoder-random forest(CDAE-RF) model is proposed to identify apple varieties based on the VIS-NIR spectrum data. Firstly, the L1 norm and other parameters are optimized through grid search or parallel experiments in order to improve the robustness of the model; then, under different noise levels, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed CDAE-RF model, principal component analysis-random forest model (PCA-RF) and K-nearest neighbor classification algorithm are analyzed by comparative experiments. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional algorithm, the accuracy of the proposed CDAE-RF model is as high as 97.92%, and has higher robustness when noise increases. In the CDAE-RF model, the sensitivity of the random forests module to noise is reduced, improving the accuracy of substance analysis under noise.*

1. Apple Origin Identification based on Near-Infrared Spectroscopy  
<u>Abstract</u>: *In this project, my team worked together to complete the construction of the hardware platform, software, and AI services. Finally, we got the identification system of apple origin. Firstly, based on the original near-infrared spectrum MEMS module, the optical path and the peripheral hardware are designed. Then, we designed the supporting software for both the computer and mobile phone; Finally, we built an AI model and the corresponding API for apple origin identification. In this project, I am mainly responsible for designing the AI model and the corresponding API. In terms of the AI model, I preprocessed the obtained data, and eliminated spectral scattering noise and baseline offset through baseline correction and SG smoothing filtering; Then, I used automatic machine learning (AutoML) technology to design an integrated machine learning model. In terms of the API, it is developed based on the Django REST framework, and I deployed it on a server with good GPU.*
