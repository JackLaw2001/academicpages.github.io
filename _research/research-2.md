**Funding**: This project is funded by the *Hunan province college students research learning and innovative experiment project*, and I am the principal investigator.
**Introduction**: As a rising technology, near-infrared spectroscopy is being widely used in food, medicine and other fields. For example, by scanning the spectrum of traditional Chinese medicine, the determination of important physical and chemical indicators of traditional Chinese medicine can be realized. However, these research results are carried out under laboratory conditions, the instruments are expensive, the professional knowledge requirements for users are high, and industrial application cannot be realized. Recently, a MEMS technology has emerged, which can make the spectrometer only the size of a palm, and at the same time greatly reduce the price. These new technologies have laid the foundation for the popularization of near-infrared spec- troscopy detection technology. In this project, we designed a complete spectral material detection system based on the MEMS near-infrared spectroscopy module. I mainly do the artificial intelligence modeling part. First, I get a practical model through data preprocessing, machine learning, deep learning modeling, etc., and then use Django REST framework to design an API interface. The project has great commercial value, and based on this, it has participated in many innovation, entrepreneurship and computer design competitions.

**Description**: 
1. A Study on Identification Model of Apple Tree Varieties Based on Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder
<u>Abstract</u>: *Combining the convolutional denoising autoencoder and random forest algorithm, a new convolutional denoising autoencoder-random forest(CDAE-RF) model is proposed to identify apple varieties based on the VIS-NIR spectrum data. Firstly,the L1 norm and other parameters are optimized through grid search or parallel experiments in order to improve the robustness of the model; then, under different noise level, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed CDAE-RF model, principal component analysis-random forest model(PCA-RF) and K-nearest neighbor classification algorithm are analyzed by comparative experiments.Experimental results show that compared with traditional algorithm, the accuracy of the proposed CDAE-RF model is as high as 97.92%, and has higher robustness when noise increases. The CDAE-RF model reduces the sensitivity of random forests algorithm to noise, improves the accuracy of noise spectral identification, and provides a new method for feature spectral identification.*
2. Identification system of apple origin based on near-infrared spectroscopy
<u>Abstract</u>: *In this project, my team worked together to complete the construction of the hardware platform, software, AI services, and finally got the identification system of apple origin. First, on the basis of the obtained near-infrared spectrum MEMS module, the optical path and the peripheral hardware are designed Then, we designed the supporting software for the computer terminal and the mobile terminal; Finally, we build a spectral recognition machine learning model and an artificial intelligence cloud service interface. In this project, I am mainly responsible for the modeling of the artificial intelligence model and the construction of the artificial intelligence cloud service interface. In terms of model building, I first preprocessed the obtained data, and eliminated spectral scattering noise and baseline offset through baseline correction, SG smoothing filtering and other methods; Then, I used automatic machine learning (AutoML) technology to design an integrated machine learning model. In terms of cloud services, I used an artificial intelligence server located in the school computer room, combined with Django REST framework to build an HTTP interface that can be called by supporting software.*
