**Backgroud**: Because of the Olympics, it became very hard to book a French visa appointment. To book an available slot, Many people have to install an auto-refresh plugin and sit in front of their computer all day to wait for an appropriate slot.

**Description**:
With the help of the *selenium* package in Python, I developed a visa assistant which can be used to monitor available slots. With this program, I successfully booked a French visa appointment.
