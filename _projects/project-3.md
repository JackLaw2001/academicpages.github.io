**Backgroud**: There is a WeChat public account that has posted a lot of blind date posts. These posts contain a lot of user information, such as gender, occupation, income, etc. However, it is not easy to retrieve this data. Firstly, these texts are in images that are not copyable. Secondly, thse images are uploaded by different users and they are in different styles. Thirdly, their structure varies a lot since there is no unified format.

**Description**:
OCR technique is used to extract texts. Before OCR, I used the *Opencv* package in python to enhance these images to make them more readable (increase contrast, etc.).
