**Backgroud**: Chinese students usually study hard, and tend to study in the library. The library is always full of students, and there are rarely any empty seats. 

**Description**:
IP geolocation can usually be accurate down to the city level. However, I learned that some IP addresses may be more likely to be assigned to specific neighborhoods. Amap is a widely used navigation app in China. This app has recorded a large amount of user IPs along with their corresponding precise locations. Through the API provided by this platform, I obtained a large number of addresses. Since students were staying home during the pandemic, these addresses are likely their home addresses.   
I used python and related packages to obtain the students' home addresses and conducted analysis. I plotted these addresses into a heat map.
