**Backgroud**: Chinese students usually study hard, and tend to study in the library. The library is always full of students, and there are rarely any empty seats. To better allocate seats, the university developed a seat reservation system. Seats are released every morning at 7 a.m. Normally, most seats will be reserved within twenty minutes of being released. Good seats, which are close to windows, will be reserved within one minute of being released.

**Description**:
By intercepting network requests, I found the key API for seat reservation. Based on the *request* package in python, I developed a seat grabbing system.
