**Backgroud**: In a Python programming course, the lecturer needs to hire a lot of markers to mark students' assignments. The marking process is mechanical and boring. Marker spends a lot of time decompressing and opening files.

**Description**:
To automate the marking process, I developed a [student marking submission system](https://github.com/JackLaw2001/Student-Submission-Marking-System). It extracts information from student submission directories and then utilizes ChatGPT models for grading various components of the submissions. In addition, markdown reports containing the assessment results and feedback will be generated after marking so that markers can adjust the marks manually. With this powerful tool, markers can complete marking in one-fifth of the time previously required.
