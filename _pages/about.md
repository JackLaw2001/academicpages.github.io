I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Newcastle University. Before I came to Newcastle University in September 2023, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Hunan Normal University. During my undergraduate studies, I was selected into the Shicheng Honor Class (now Shicheng Hornor College, 世承书院) and received systematic research skills training under the supervision of Prof. Lin Xiao. At present, I am supervised by Dr. Jichun Li and Dr. Yujiang Wang ([CNNP Lab](https://www.cnnp-lab.com/)) and am doing research on neural networks and intelligent computing.
