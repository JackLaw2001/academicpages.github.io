In addition to the projects mentioned in the <a href="https://jacklaw2001.github.io/research/">Research</a> section, Iâ€™ve also worked on some small but fun projects in my spare time. I did these projects out of interest. Overall, I am interested in data science and algorithms. In my spare time, I enjoy scraping data and uncovering meaningful patterns from it.
